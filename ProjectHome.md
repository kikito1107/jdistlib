A set of components for creating distributed applications using JavaSpaces and JINI. It's implemented in Java, so you are able to use it in any platform you want.

The goal is to create a platform for auto-adapting applications to the network that they're connected to or even the place where the user is situated. We provide a set of classes for developing plugins for the platform. Every plugin is distributed through the network without downloading them in a "classical" way.

The platform not only gives you the posibility to share applications but also you are able to share files.

Every single graphical component it's a javabean for reusing it in any application you want. Furthermore, you can use this components with a GUI builder. Every bean that we provide have the possibility to use distributed events.
